# Best Papers at conferences

Collections of awesome decoding of best papers which published at top conferences. And conference fields consists of machine learning, data mining and artificial intelligence. E.g. ***International Conference on Learning Representations(ICLR)***; ***International Conference on Machine Learning(ICML)***; ***Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining(KDD)***.

## @2019
- ICLR:
  1. **Ordered Neurons: Integrating Tree Structures Into Recurrent Neural Networks**
      *  key-concepts: tree-structured LSTM, new activation: cumax(), enforcing the order in neurons 
  2. **The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks**
      *  key-concepts: sub-networks, iterative pruning, initialization
  3. Learned from this blog: [Decoding the Best Papers from ICLR 2019 â€“ Neural Networks are Here to Rule](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/05/best-papers-iclr-2019/)

- KDD:
  1. **dEFEND: Explainable Fake News Detection**: Integrate news content and user comments for improving fake news detection, and introduce co-attention mechanism that can provide some important news sentence and comments to explain why a piece of news is fake.
      *  key-concepts: bi-directional GRU, co-attention, hierarchical neural network
